# Data-Structures-And-Program-Design
This repository consists of the mini-projects submitted as part of the Data Structures and Program Design course of second year, B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.

## Stock Data Manager (DSPD_I_Assignment1_Structures)
The program is designed to handle stock-related data fetched from multiple CSV files using file handling in C. It utilizes structures to organize the data, with each structure representing the Open, High, Low, Close prices, and volume of a stock. Key functions provided include:
1) Compute percentage change in stock price between specified dates.
2) Sort stock data by volume and close prices.
3) Calculate profit/loss for bought and sold stocks.
4) Identify highest/lowest performing stocks for a duration.
5) List stocks by performance.
6) Find average of average stock values within a date range.

## Flight Management Platform (DSPD_II_Assignment1_LinkedLists)
This program implements an in-air flight-management platform for an air-traffic control (ATC) system. It features a digital dashboard for managing in-air flights, utilizing a linked list-based database organized in 60-minute intervals based on expected time of arrival (ETA).
The system maintains an active database of flight buckets, sorted by ETA intervals. Each bucket contains a unique identifier, the start and end times of the ETA interval, and a database of flight-plans. Flight-plans consist of a flight ID, actual departure time, and ETA.
Key functions provided are:
1) Insertion, deletion, and search of flight plans within the database.
2) Displaying all flight data.
3) Rearranging buckets based on given time criteria.

These functions enable efficient management and monitoring of in-air flights within the ATC system, ensuring timely and accurate handling of flight data.
